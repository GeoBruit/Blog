<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello,
My name is George I got started with programming a little while ago, I was amazed by the things I have learned and I m still learning.
This blog project taught me so much about working with the Django framework with HTML and CSS.
You can find my LinkedIn account as well as my GitHub Account by clicking the icons on the navbar.
Thank you for checking out my project!</p>
