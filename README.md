My first Clone Project

Hello!
I have completed this project under the "Python and Django full stack Bootcamp" course.
I have learned so much from doing this project, things such as working with Clase-Based Views and working with models and URLs.
I have learned how to create forms and how to work with user logins.
It was a great project to learn from, if you have any constructive feedback please feel free to leave a comment as it is greatly appreciated!
Thank you!
